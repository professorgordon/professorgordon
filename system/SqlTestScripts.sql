'Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.<br><br>For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.<br><br>Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.');

'My fathers family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.<br><br>I give Pirrip as my fathers family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my fathers, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, “Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,” I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.<br><br>Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.');

'To be, or not to be, that is the Question:<br>
Whether tis Nobler in the minde to suffer<br>
The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,<br>
Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,<br>
And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe<br>
No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end<br>
The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes<br>
That Flesh is heyre too? Tis a consummation<br>
Deuoutly to be wishd. To dye to sleepe,<br>
To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, theres the rub,<br>
For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,<br>
When we haue shuffeld off this mortall coile,<br>
Must giue vs pawse. Theres the respect<br>
That makes Calamity of so long life:<br>
For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,<br>
The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,<br>
The pangs of disprizd Loue, the Lawes delay,<br>
The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes<br>
That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,<br>
When he himselfe might his Quietus make<br>
With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare<br>
To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death,<br>
The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne<br>
No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,<br>
And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,<br>
Then flye to others that we know not of.<br>
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,<br>
And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution<br>
Is sicklied ore, with the pale cast of Thought,<br>
And enterprizes of great pith and moment,<br>
With this regard their Currants turne away,<br>
And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,<br>
The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons<br>
Be all my sinnes remembred<br>');
